# Employee-Payroll-System


👨‍💼 Project Overview: 

The Employee Payroll System is a Java-based console application designed to manage the payroll and employee details for a company. It allows users to add, remove, and display employee information while calculating salaries for both full-time and part-time employees. The system uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism, and encapsulation to make the code reusable and scalable.

This system can handle two types of employees:

Full-Time Employees - Salaried employees with a fixed monthly salary.
Part-Time Employees - Employees paid based on hours worked and hourly rates.


🛠️ Features of the Employee Payroll System:

📋 Employee Management:
Add employees to the system (both full-time and part-time).
Remove employees from the system (e.g., when an employee resigns).
Display a list of all employees along with their details:
Name
ID
Salary


💰 Salary Calculation
Full-Time Employees:
➤ Salary is calculated as the fixed monthly amount.
Part-Time Employees:
➤ Salary is calculated as hoursWorked × hourlyRate.


🌟 Key Functionalities
Add Employee: Easily add new employees with specific details such as name, ID, and salary-related information.
Remove Employee: Remove an employee from the payroll by their unique ID.
Display Employees: View all employees in the system with their details and calculated salaries.
