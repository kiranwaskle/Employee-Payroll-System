# Employee-Payroll-System
This Java project implements an **Employee Payroll System** using **OOP concepts** like abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. It includes an abstract `Employee` class with `FullTimeEmployee` and `PartTimeEmployee` subclasses for salary calculations and a `PayrollSystem` class to manage employee records efficiently.
